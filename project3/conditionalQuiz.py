The Objective of this program is to quiz the user on basic high school
trivia. The tasks to complete are:
-Ask the user each of the following questions:
    1) What is the power house of the cell?
        A) mitochondria B) nucleous C) ribosome
    2) How many states comprise the United States?
        A) 13 B) 45 C) 50
    3) In y = mx + b, what does m stand for?
        A) slope B) output C) I don't understand math
    4) In English, a person, place or thing is called:
        A) verb B) adjective C) noun
-The user should input a letter for each question. (A, B, or C)
-Check the users answer, if it is correct print "Correct", else it should
print "Incorrect, the correct answer is [insert]"
-Additionally, the program should track how many questions the user
got correct and at the end give them a score out of 4. And give them a 
percentage.

Need to Know:
.upper() and .lower()

#Calculate the percentage the user got. And store it in a variable called p

p = correctAns / 4

#Print out the users score: "You got a [score]/4. Or a [p]%."

print("You got a " + str(correctAns) + "/4. Or a " + str(p) + "%.")
