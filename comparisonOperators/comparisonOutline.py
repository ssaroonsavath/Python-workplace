#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.



#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.



#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.



#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.



#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
